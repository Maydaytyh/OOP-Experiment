  3.2 Define a member function, Relationship, to judge the relationship such as seperation, intersection, tangent(intenally or externally tangent) between two circles. 
  Note: You can define appropriate parameters according to your member functions.



[optional] 
   Define an array of int. Take the starting address of that array and use static_cast to convert it into and void*. 
   Write a function that takes a void*, a number(indicating a number of bytes), and a value(indicating the value to which each byte should be set) as arguments. 
   The function should set each byte in the specified range to the spcified value. Try out the function on your array of int.
